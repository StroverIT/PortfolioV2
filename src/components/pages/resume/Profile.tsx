        From humble beginnings, my 5+ years as a React developer have
        been a journey of growth. My path began with a curiosity to
        understand clients&apos; needs, which led me to land projects. I
        see coding as a tool to gain knowledge, each project teaching me
        something new. With React, MongoDB and TypeScript, I&apos;ve
        shaped data-driven, scalable solutions. My experience reflects
        adaptability and a passion for problem-solving. Let&apos;s build
        a future together, driven by practical wisdom.
